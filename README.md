# HP-BERT: A Framework for Longitudinal Study of Hinduphobia on Social Media via LLMs

## Analysis of Hinduphobia on X (Twitter) During and After COVID-19

### Abstract

During the COVID-19 pandemic, community tensions intensified, fueling Hinduphobic sentiments and discrimination against individuals of Hindu descent both within India and globally. Large language models (LLMs) have become prominent tools in natural language processing (NLP) and social media analysis, enabling longitudinal studies of platforms like X (formerly Twitter) for tracking specific issues over time, particularly during the COVID-19 crisis. In this work, we present an abuse detection and sentiment analysis framework designed for a longitudinal analysis of Hinduphobia on X (Twitter) during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. This framework assesses the prevalence and intensity of Hinduphobic discourse, identifying derogatory jokes and racist remarks through sentiment analysis and abuse detection using pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs. Additionally, we curated and published the **Hinduphobic COVID-19 X (Twitter) Dataset**, containing 8,000 tweets annotated for Hinduphobic abuse detection. This dataset was used to fine-tune a BERT model, which led to the development of the **Hinduphobic BERT (HP-BERT)** model. We further enhanced HP-BERT by fine-tuning it with the **SenWave** dataset for multi-label sentiment analysis. Our study spans approximately 27.4 million tweets from six countries: Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The findings reveal a strong correlation between spikes in COVID-19 cases and surges in Hinduphobic rhetoric, highlighting the role of political narratives, misinformation, and targeted jokes in contributing to communal polarization. These insights provide valuable guidance for developing strategies to mitigate communal tensions during future crises, both locally and globally. We advocate for the implementation of automated monitoring and removal of such content on social media platforms to curb divisive discourse.
